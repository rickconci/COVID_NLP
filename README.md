# MedTech Covid19 Hackathon 5th April 2020

Our challenge is " How to keep up to date with the latest research in COVID-19?"
Our idea is to create a natural language processing powered algorithm that can extract essential information from publications on a specific clustered topic (e.g. hydroxychloroquine usage) and generate a summary table to clearly show the publications supporting or against a research question, ranked by citation metrics and level of evidence.
